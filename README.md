# Weather-prediction-by-Random-forest-Algorithms
This project focuses on predicting weather conditions (Rain: True/False) using the Random Forest Machine Learning algorithm. The model is trained on historical weather data and uses multiple meteorological features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and outlook conditions to make accurate predictions.
